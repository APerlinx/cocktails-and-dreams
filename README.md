# Cocktails & Dreams

**Live:** [https://www.cocktailsndreams.art](https://www.cocktailsndreams.art)

A fast, responsive marketing site for an active cocktail bar, built with **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**. Hebrew-first (RTL), SEO-minded, and designed for quick LCP.

## What it is

A production website for a real business. Focused on clear CTAs (WhatsApp/phone), strong visual identity, and smooth mobile UX.

---

## My role & scope

* End‑to‑end design & development
* Deployment and ongoing optimization (Vercel)
* Content structure, metadata, and accessibility polish

---

## Highlights

* **RTL Hebrew**: typography, spacing, and layout tuned for right‑to‑left.
* **App Router + TS**: server components where sensible, clean route structure.
* **Media performance**: `next/image` for responsive images; background video is lazy and non‑blocking.
* **SEO foundations**: Metadata API, OpenGraph, canonical URL; per‑page titles/descriptions.
* **Accessible by default**: focus styles, keyboard nav, contrast checks.
* **Secure media fetching**: gallery content comes via server endpoints (no client‑side secrets).

---

## Key pages

* **Home** – hero media, service highlights, primary CTAs
* **Gallery** – responsive grid with hover states
* **Workshops/Services** – clear offer and contact paths
* **Contact** – WhatsApp/phone/email with proper semantics

---

## Tech

* **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Fonts:** `next/font` (Geist)
* **Icons:** lucide-react
* **Hosting:** Vercel

---

## Performance & SEO notes

* Optimized hero media to protect **LCP** on mobile.
* `metadataBase` + canonical to avoid duplicates and fix social previews.
* Image sizes set for responsive breakpoints; defer non‑critical JS.
